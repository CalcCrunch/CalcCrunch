Hello, my name is Nathan Singiri and I am an aspiring quant. 
As such, I have focused my efforts on cultivating and enhancing my mathematical, financial, and software development skills.
I will attempt to create several substantial projects through github not only to practice my programming skills, but to 
put my Java & Python skills to the test, while creating fun, interactive applications for other people.
